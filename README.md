Project 1 (Resistance Calculator)
Reads the resistor bands and calculates the equivalent resistance for a circuit type
-Fix needed to display correct units

Project 2 (Bingo Card Generator)
Generates random valid bingo cards that are unique with no repetitions. 
We can choose the number of players and cards, and new cards are created
for each player in a 4 dimensional array. The user can choose to display a
card, and also view a histogram of all values.

Project 3 (Bingo Game)
This code was an extension of project 2 where we can actually play bingo.
It includes all options for the user from project 2, as well as a playing
bingo option. The user can manually make real bingo calls until a winner
is found. The winning functions allow for row, column, diagonal, and
corner wins.

Project 4 (Word Search Solver)
The goal of this code is to solve a word search, given information from a 
text file. The text file includes the dimensions of a word search grid,
the grid of mixed up letters, and a list of all the words to look for.
The grid is stored in a dynamic array, and the words are chained by a 
linked list. After this, a doubly linked list is created from the word
list that includes every words occurance where it started and what direction
the word was found in. From there all the words and occurances are printed
out for the user to see and check.
